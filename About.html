She also holds a management degree from Bharathidasan Institute of Management.<br/>She worked as a research collaborator for the national project on gifted education with National institute of advanced studies (NIAS), IISC Campus.She believes that the academic structure should be remodelled based on the needs of an evolving society and environment, as we really cannot imagine how the social and work environment would be after 20 years.<br/>Her vision for Vivriti is to provide thoughtfully prepared learning environment, designed to stimulate the learning and development of every child, tailored to each child’s individual abilities, behaviours and preferences. She strongly advocates a collaborative set up involving the families and societies for future learners, as the collaboration brings a wide set of experience to the children.<br/>At Vivriti, she encourages the practice for every individual to think, question and reflect. She envisions to build an institution where the children with the help of the competent team of adults are capable of making choices and decisions and realise their full potential as learners.</p>

She strongly supports the fact that when children take responsibility for their own education, they become independent thinkers  & life-long learners. These skills help them to become global citizens and thinking leaders.<br/>She affirms that the best way to lead a team of individuals is to give them the freedom to think and express with the belief that those thoughts will be considered and respected. Being a great team worker, she provides the staff with discrete opportunities to develop their roles as facilitators of students’ learning. She facilitates learning sessions with teachers and other experts to provide innovative learning ideas for implementing the curriculum.<br/>She firmly believes that a restructured education system could provide a stronger foundation for the coming generations to achieve their dreams.</p>

During her 15 years long career, she has piloted the inception of the first international school at Kochi Kerala as a registrar and was also the Headmistress of a professionally run Kindergarten School.</br/>She is self-motivated with strong planning, organizational and leadership skills. She is also an avid sportsman and represented my district in swimming at state levels. Her hobbies include organizing cultural events, traveling and listening to music. Education has ever been her passion and she started my career with a dream to contribute immensely in this domain.<br/>Her experience with preschool inspired her not only to think about how she views children but also how she views all those people who support children viz parents, teachers, and support staff. It confirmed her belief about the innate competence of young children and stimulated her to look more deeply at how she could support them in their development. She listens to children, values what they have to say, treats them with kindness, and gives them time, attention, and respect<br/>She firmly believes that children have the right to engage with a wide range of resources designed to widen, challenge and consolidate their thinking.</p>

						<p class="text-justify">Navita Bhat has an Industry Integrated Diploma in Mechanical Engineering and has been involved with an International School with management and school activities during her stay in Europe.<br/>I believe that the early schooling years are the most defining years of an individual and should be the most enjoyable period in a child’s life.<br/>I believe good social skills are critical to successful functioning in life. Since the children spent most of their day at school, we play a key role in facilitating development of their social skills. My Mechanical engineering background coupled with good communication skills helps me to train my staff and children to interact and negotiate on logical grounds thereby strengthen their social competence.<br/>My last five years experience as a director of Vivriti made me realise that Passion, dedication, patience, loving and caring attitude by the caregivers is what goes to provide a wonderful, safe & home like environment for children to develop their abilities. I train my staff to facilitate the learning process through inquiry and discuss different topics to spark their curiosity. I also believe in an environment of open communication between children, parents & the staff thereby build collaborative partnership linking home and school in a climate of trust and respect. This helped us a great deal and our children enjoy coming to school and learning in a safe environment.</p>
