							<h2>After School Enrtichment program</h2>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="modal-body">
						<p class="text-justify">The After-school Program is intended to enrich the child’s experience during the hours after school through activities structured thoughtfully to meet the developmental needs of our children. Our idea is to provide a combination of academic, cultural, fitness and recreational activities in a project-based or theme-based manner. The activities are designed to broaden children’s world, to take them beyond the core curriculum and further stimulate their minds, enhance their development and help them explore the many opportunities that await them. We also design certain activities to tap into the natural play and inquisitiveness of our children. The programs are designed for children between the ages of 4 to 12 years, These are some of the activities planned for the children<h5>1. Scientific Inquiry time:</h5>The facilitators create an environment in which children explore to acquire basic science inquiry skills (predicting, observing, explaining) and to transfer these skills to age appropriate writing, schematic representation or painting. By deepening thoughts through experiential learning and discovery, a child progresses from knowledge acquisition to analysis and application. We go beyond "what" and examine "why" and "how."<h5>2. Technology time:</h5>We believe that general technological competencies are a must for young children in a rapidly emerging hi-tech society. We introduce the children to internet and related technical skills. We have always believed that technology can have a positive impact on students, as an educational tool, to enhance learning, increase productivity and promote creativity.<h5>3. Fitness time:</h5>Helps keep your child active and healthy; daily Yoga, dance movements with Anitha .<h5>4. Recreational activities:</h5>Dance classes by dance teacher Swapna on Wednesdays and Fridays. Music by Pragnya on tuesdays<h5>5. Soft-Skill development:</h5>Emphasis on developing leadership and communication skills. We encourage the children to speak about their topic of interest onstage with their peers and teachers as audience<h5>6. Nature walks, Park visits & Outdoor play:</h5>These activities support the enhancement of the natural curiosity of the child along with the physical developmental needs.<h5>7. Arts &Craft Time</h5></p>
